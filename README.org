reorg-onedrive is a bridge between emacs(org-mode) and the remarkable via OneDrive. A pure =reorg= is still in development due to difficulty with the API - this is best option for now.

* Dependencies
+ rclone
+ OneDrive
+ Paid Remarkable Cloud

* Installation 
1. Create a =reorg= folder in the root of your one-drive.
2. Setup rclone with a config called =reorg=
#+begin_src bash
rclone config
#+end_src
3. Get the latest release =.el= files
4. Add =(load "/home/velo/Documents/Projects/reorg/reorg-onedrive.el")= to your config.

* Usage
** Downloading Files
You can easily download files from your OneDrive via =(reorg-onedrive/download-file)=. This will prompt you to choose a file from the list obtained using rclone.
** Uploading Files
You can upload any file with =(reorg-onedrive/upload-file)=.
*** Org-mode
Open up a =.org= file in a buffer and run =reorg-onedrive/org-send-buffer-to-remarkable=, or =reorg-onedrive/org-send-file-to-remarkable= to upload any file you select.
